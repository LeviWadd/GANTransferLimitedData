# GANTransferLimitedData
This is a pytorch implementation of the paper 
"On Leveraging Pretrained GANs for Limited-Data Generation".
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.11810.pdf

"CELEBA_[f]GmDn.py" is the implementation of the model in Figure1(f).
"Flower_[h]our.py" is the implementation of the model in Figure1(h).
You will need to download the pretrained GP-GAN model before running the code.
